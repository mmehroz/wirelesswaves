					<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TAMHS Business Inc (Wireless Waves) takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants you to feel comfortable using this web site. This privacy policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as "data" below) that may be collected by this site. This policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by Wireless Waves, nor does it apply to persons that are not employees or agents of Wireless Waves, or that are not under Wireless Waves' control. Please take time to read this site's Terms of use.</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
					<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collection of data</span></h2>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration for an account on this site requires only a valid e-mail address and a user name that has not been chosen already. You are not required to provide any other information if you do not want to. Please be aware that the user name you choose, the e-mail address you provide and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on this web site intentionally (depending on choices you make during the registration process, or depending on the way in which the site is configured) or unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). As on many web sites, Wireless Waves may also automatically receive general information that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information. Information about how advertising may be served on this site (if it is indeed Wireless Waves' policy to display advertising) is set forth below.</span></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of data</span></h2>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data may be used to customize and improve your user experience on this site. Efforts will be made to prevent your data being made available to third parties unless (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; (ii) your consent is obtained, such as when you choose to opt-in or opt-out for the sharing of data; (iii) a service provided on our site requires interaction with a third party, or is provided by a third party, such as an application service provider; (iv) pursuant to legal action or law enforcement; (v) it is found that your use of this site violates Wireless Waves's policy, terms of service, or other usage guidelines, or if it is deemed reasonably necessary by Wireless Waves to protect Wireless Waves' legal rights and/or property; or (vi) this site is purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will be able to use the data in the same manner as set forth in this policy. In the event you choose to use links displayed on this web site to visit other websites, you are advised to read the privacy policies published on those sites.</span></p>

					<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies</span></h2>
